scheme-snippets, by Phil Yeeles (loomcore)
==========================================
A collection of Scheme nuggets that will hopefully be of use as
examples in Code Club, or for other Scheme learners.  Developed using
Chicken, so some (especially those that use the Chicken SRFI
extensions) may require modification to run properly on other Scheme
implementations.

Contents:
---------
- expanded.scm:  Transform an S-expression into a well-laid-out
                 calculation using the `expanded method' (incomplete).
- fib.scm:       Generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a
                 specified limit.
- fizzbuzz.scm:  Generate a sequence of numbers omitting those with
                 specified factors, à la the maths game FizzBuzz.
- gol.scm:       An ASCII implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a
                 popular cellular automaton (incomplete).
- quicksort.scm: Use the Quicksort algorithm to sort lists of numbers.
- sierp.scm:     Generate an ASCII-art Sierpiński Triangle to a
                 specified depth.
- subtract.scm:  Solve a subtraction problem for two-digit numbers
                 using the `expanded method'.

Enjoy!
